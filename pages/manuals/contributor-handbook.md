# The Faithful Contributor's Handbook
### *A step-by-step guide on how to create and submit textures for Faithful, and vote on them afterwards*

*If you’re reading this, you’ve most likely decided to help Faithful out and make a texture! For that, we sincerely thank you. Faithful is a fully community-run project, and wouldn’t be able to exist without volunteers like yourself!*

Now, let's get started.

## Creating Textures

Before you begin, we highly recommend reading the texturing guidelines for the pack being contributed to, as every texture in Faithful needs to follow them. You can find these either with the `/guidelines` command on Discord or on this site in the "Textures" category. The guidelines also contain a lot of handy texturing tips that you might find useful down the line.

If you’re looking for a good program for pixel art, here’s what some of our best artists use:
- **Aseprite (paid, but free if you compile it from source yourself – [useful tool](https://github.com/TheLiteCrafter/AsepriteTool/releases/), [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/4amv2bAWJAA))** – Made specifically for pixel art. Offers useful options like several tiling modes and easy palette manipulation.
- **Paint.net (also known as PDN; free)** – An all-purpose image manipulation program, easy to learn, but only works on Windows.
- **GIMP (free)** – More capable than Paint.net, doesn't require Windows, but harder to learn for beginners.
- **Photoshop (paid)** – Expensive without an already existing license, however this works for basically everything.

To help you choose a texture to make, use the `/missing` command to list textures that Faithful is lacking for a given version and edition. Those are needed the most, but you can still edit or remake an existing texture as well if you so please.

Finally, during the creation of your texture, we recommend that you share your progress in the project's #texture-discussion channel. This will allow for others to give feedback and help you improve your texture before submission.

## Formatting a Submission

Once you’re done with your texture, submit it by uploading a PNG file in the proper channel. Make sure the filename is exactly the same as the name of the texture in the game files!

::: details But which channel submits to which project?

Here's a handy guide:
- [#32x-submit-textures](https://discord.com/channels/773983706582482946/773987409993793546) – Faithful 32x
- [#64x-submit-textures](https://discord.com/channels/773983706582482946/931887174977208370) – Faithful 64x
- [#32x-submit-progart](https://discord.com/channels/814198513847631944/909503944118648883) – Classic Faithful 32x
- [#64x-submit-progart](https://discord.com/channels/814198513847631944/1320159924625473599) – Classic Faithful 64x
- [#32x-submit-jappa](https://discord.com/channels/814198513847631944/814201529032114226) – Classic Faithful 32x Jappa
- [#64x-submit-jappa](https://discord.com/channels/814198513847631944/814209343502286899) – Classic Faithful 64x Jappa

The former two channels are on the [main Discord](https://discord.gg/sN9YRQbBv7), and the latter four are on the [Classic Faithful Discord](https://discord.gg/KSEhCVtg4J).
:::

You can upload multiple textures in one message if you made an entire set of textures, such as wool or planks, and optionally attach a comment to your submission using the text content of your message.

If you’re submitting a texture with a name that is present more than once in the vanilla files (such as `jungle.png`, which is the name of a villager, sign, and boat texture), wait for a bit after sending your message. The bot will ask you to clarify which texture you’re submitting with a dropdown menu.

If there are many textures with the same filename and you don't want to deal with the dropdown menus, you can also submit by texture ID (the numbers in front of the texture name in embeds or on the gallery). For instance, if your texture's filename is `307` or you include `[#307]` in your submission comment (with the square brackets and hashtag to prevent normal numbers in comments getting flagged), found textures will be overridden and texture 307 (dirt) will instead be submitted.

## Crediting Contributions

Any and all reused parts of an existing Faithful texture should be credited in your submission (you can find who made a texture using the `/texture` command). Additionally, if you’ve collaborated with someone else while making the texture, credit the co-author(s) as well.

In the submission comment, simply surround each co-author's username in curly brackets, so the bot can detect them as a contributor. For example, "Fixed a false line. Credit to {Author} for the original texture." would credit Author. If you're simply tweaking an existing texture, prefix your submission description with a plus sign (+) to add all the previous co-authors to the texture automatically.

One thing to note about using curly brackets is that the name is based on the user's web app profile, not their Discord username. If these are different, or you don't want to go through the trouble of finding the correct username, you can alternatively ping the author in the comment to add them as well—both methods work in exactly the same way besides the former saving a ghost ping. If credits for a texture are missing, you don’t need to worry about any of this.

You can delete your submission at any time by clicking the arrow icon below your submission, waiting for the bot to finish reacting, and reacting with the trash bin icon. Additionally, if you ever want your texture removed from Faithful after it has passed voting and been added, message a manager or council member and they will remove your texture.

Finally, please know that by submitting a texture, you agree to allow:
- The texture to be used in any public or development version of Faithful.
- The texture to be used directly or in a modified state in other projects under the Faithful umbrella. (Classic Faithful, Faithful Tweaks/Add-ons etc.)
- The texture to be used in/as a base for other textures meant for Faithful.
- Others to edit your texture without any required prior notice, and allow them to submit the edited texture to Faithful, with appropriate credit.

## Voting on Textures and the Texture Approval Process

Whether a texture makes it into Faithful or not is determined by a community vote. This period lasts for 2 days and is open to everybody. To vote on a submission, simply click on the check mark ✅ or cross ❌ button depending on whether you like the texture or not. Before you vote however, keep in mind that you should do the following:

- **Clearly view the texture:** You should always get a clear look at the texture before voting on it. The size of the texture you see in submissions can sometimes be too small and compressed to view properly, particularly on UI textures, so you can use the magnifying glass button to view the texture more closely (this button is also a slash command: `/magnify`). If an edit to an existing texture has been submitted, you can also use the eye button to see the exact pixel differences between the proposed and current textures.

- **Compare different resolutions:** When evaluating a texture, you shouldn’t just look at the submitted work, but also should examine it against the reference texture it was based on. Using the comparison image inside the submission embed, try to look for consistency issues such as incorrect color placement, incorrect shape sizes, and detail not present in the original. It's also worth noting that for 64x packs, the reference texture is usually the 32x texture rather than the vanilla texture, so you should examine both to ensure the reference is accurate as well.

- **Communicate issues to the author:** Communicating issues to the author is a crucial part of the evaluation process. Try to explain to the original author what issues the texture has, and give actionable advice on how to fix these issues. Remember, constructive criticism is key—simply saying that "this texture is bad" with no elaboration is no help to anyone.

::: warning REMEMBER:
Never vote based on how many votes a texture already has! **Always vote based on your own individual opinion.**
:::

Besides the upvote and downvote options regular users get, there are two other options that the council and managers have:

1. **Instapass**: An instapass (a portmanteau of "instantly-passed texture") is when a texture skips the voting process and is added immediately. This may be for recolours of another texture, consistency fixes for outdated textures, or texture bugs that needed fixing.

2. **Invalidation**: A texture is invalidated when it objectively breaks the guidelines. It must be justified by a council member and is generally reserved for particularly contentious textures.
