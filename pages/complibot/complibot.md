# We developed a Discord bot...
...and we think it turned out pretty good, so we made it open-source.

This bot manages a lot of things on our servers and is improving day by day.
Help develop it or make a feature request on its [repository](https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Discord-Bot).
Also, feel free to [report any bugs](https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Discord-Bot/labels/bug) you may encounter on your adventure.

Furthermore, feel free to try it out on one of our Discord servers.
